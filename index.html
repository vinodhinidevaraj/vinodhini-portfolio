    <h2>Understanding Customer Satisfaction Through Data</h2>
    <div class="meta">Published on March 2026 • 8 min read</div>

    <p>
        In this analysis, I explored the Amazon Customer Behavior Survey dataset 
        to understand what truly drives customer satisfaction. The dataset consisted 
        of 602 observations covering purchase habits, browsing frequency, ratings, 
        and demographic information.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploring Purchase & Browsing Patterns</h2>

    <p>
        The majority of customers reported purchasing a few times a month, 
        while browsing behavior showed higher weekly engagement. 
        These initial descriptive statistics gave a foundational view of customer activity patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Is The Data Normally Distributed?</h2>

    <p>
        Using histogram visualization and the Anderson-Darling test, 
        I examined whether the dataset followed a normal distribution. 
        The results clearly indicated non-normality across multiple significance levels.
        This meant parametric tests were not ideal for further statistical modeling.
    </p>

    <h2>Correlation Insights</h2>

    <p>
        One of the strongest findings was the relationship between 
        <strong>Rating Accuracy</strong> and <strong>Shopping Satisfaction</strong>, 
        with a correlation coefficient of 0.514 — indicating a moderate positive relationship.
        Interestingly, age showed almost no correlation with satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Regression Model</h2>

    <p>
        A simple linear regression model revealed that Rating Accuracy explains 
        approximately 26.4% of the variance in Shopping Satisfaction (R² = 0.264). 
        The coefficient was statistically significant (p < 0.001), 
        reinforcing that accurate ratings significantly impact customer experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Customer Segmentation</h2>

    <p>
        I implemented K-means clustering using purchase frequency, 
        review importance, and satisfaction scores to identify behavioral segments. 
        This segmentation can help businesses tailor marketing strategies 
        for different customer groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>

    <p>
        Customer satisfaction is strongly influenced by trust in ratings and reviews. 
        Improving rating transparency and personalization mechanisms 
        can significantly enhance user experience in e-commerce platforms.
    </p>
